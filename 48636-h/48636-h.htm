<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Letters received from soldiers in the field describe
many features of the various campaigns of
the war, the descriptions coming from representatives
of widely differing classes of society. Unlike
the rigid censorship imposed on the allied
troopers by their official censors; the letters of
Germans in the field show that wide liberty of expression
is allowed, with only the names of places,
troop divisions, and commanders, and occasionally
dates, deleted.</p>

<p>At the front are many men of prominence in
many walks of life. Some of the greatest present-day
poets and novelists are in the field, and
that, too, serving in humble capacities, taking
their risks side by side with the men in the ranks
or as non-commissioned officers and sharing the
daily routine of the common soldier's life. Undemocratic
as officialdom is in times of peace, and
harsh as its discipline has been pictured in time
of war, letters from notables at the front show a
surprising spirit of democracy in the relations of
high and low on the battlefield, in the trenches,
and on the march.</p>

<p>The letters from the front include missives
penned or scribbled by nobles and members of
the royal families, high military officials, authors,
Socialists, tradesmen, skilled workmen, and writers
who, in peace times, have been more expert
with the farmhand's scythe or manure fork, or
with the street cleaner's broom than with the pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that is supposedly mightier, and certainly to them
more unwieldy, than the sword.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even among the privates, it is extremely
rare that a letter shows illiteracy to any
marked degree. In the letters written by high
and low alike, there is to be noted a certain theatrical
consciousness of the stage on which they
are now engaged in battle before the world.</p>

<h2>WAR STORIES.</h2>




<h2><a name="THREE_MONTHS_IN_THE_TRENCHES" id="THREE_MONTHS_IN_THE_TRENCHES">THREE MONTHS IN THE TRENCHES.</a></h2>

<p class="hanging">AMERICAN WHO SERVED WITH THE FRENCH FOREIGN
LEGION, NOW AN AIRMAN, GIVES VIVID ACCOUNT
OF "DITCH" LIFE.</p>


<p><i>Bert Hall, who wrote the article printed herewith,
is an American, and has had experience both
as a racing automobile driver and an airman. At
the beginning of the war he joined the French
Foreign Legion, but was afterward transferred to
the French Aviation Corps.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Bert Hall.</span></p>

<p>There was no hands-across-the-sea Lafayette
stuff about us Americans who joined the Foreign
Legion in Paris when the war broke out. We just
wanted to get right close and see some of the fun,
and we didn't mind taking a few risks, as most of
us had led a pretty rough sort of life as long as
we could remember.</p>

<p>For my part, auto racing&mdash;including one peach
of a smash-up in a famous race&mdash;followed by three
years of flying, had taken the edge off my capacity
for thrills, but I thought I'd get a new line of excitement
with the legion in a big war, and I reckon
most of the other boys had much the same idea.</p>

<p>We got a little excitement, though not much, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
as for fun&mdash;well, if I had to go through it again
I'd sooner attend my own funeral. As a sporting
proposition, this war game is overrated. Altogether,
I spent nearly three months in the trenches
near Craonne, and, believe me, I was mighty glad
when they transferred me (with Thaw and Bach,
two other Americans who've done some flying) to
the Aviation Corps, for all they wouldn't take us
when we volunteered at the start because we
weren't Frenchmen, and have only done so now
because they've lost such a lot of their own men,
which isn't a very encouraging reason.</p>

<p>But anyway if the Germans do wing us, it's a
decent, quick finish, and I for one prefer it to slow
starvation or being frozen stiff in a stinking, muddy
trench. Why, I tell you, when I got wounded
and had to leave, most of the boys were so sick of
life in the trenches that they used to walk about
outside in the daytime almost hoping the Germans
would hit them&mdash;anything to break the monotony
of the ceaseless rain and cold and hunger
and dirt!</p>

<p>It wasn't so bad when we first got there, about
the beginning of October, as the weather was
warmer (though it had already begun to rain and
has never stopped since), but we were almost suffocated
by the stench from the thousands of
corpses lying between the lines&mdash;the German
trenches were about four hundred yards away&mdash;where
it wasn't safe for either side to go out and
bury them. They were French mostly, result of
the first big offensive after the Marne victory,
and, believe me, that word just expresses it&mdash;they
were the offensivest proposition in all my experience.</p>

<p>Well, as I was saying, we reached the firing line
on October 4, after marching up from Toulouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
where they'd moved us from Rouen to finish our
training. We went down there in a cattle truck at
the end of August in a hurry, as they expected the
Germans any minute; the journey took sixty hours
instead of ten, and was frightfully hot. That was
our first experience of what service in the Foreign
Legion really meant&mdash;just the sordidest, uncomfortablest
road to glory ever trodden by
American adventurers.</p>

<p>After we'd been at Toulouse about a month,
they incorporated about two hundred of us recruits&mdash;thirty
Americans and the rest mostly
Britishers, all of whom had seen some sort of
service before&mdash;in the Second Regiment Etranger
which had just come over from Africa on its way
to the front. They put us all together in one company,
which was something to be thankful for, as
I'd hate to leave a cur dog among some of the
old-timers&mdash;you never saw such a lot of scoundrels.
I'll bet a hundred dollars they have specimens
of every sort of criminal in Europe, and,
what's more, lots of them spoke German, though
they claimed to have left seventeen hundred of
the real Dutchies behind in Africa. Can you beat
it? Going out to fight for France against the
Kaiser among a lot of guys that looked and talked
like a turn verein at St. Louis!</p>

<p>Why, one day Thaw and I captured a Dutchie
in a wood where we were hunting squirrel&mdash;as a
necessary addition to our diet&mdash;and, believe me,
when we brought him into camp he must have
thought he was at home, for they all began jabbering
German to him as friendly as possible, and
every one was quite sad when he went off in a
train with a lot of other prisoners bound for some
fortress in the West of France.</p>

<p>But that was only a detail, and now I'm telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you about our arrival in the trenches. The last
hundred miles we did in five days, which is some
of a hurry; but none of the Americans fell out,
though we were all mighty tired at the end of the
last day's march. Worse still, that country had
all been fought over, and there were no inhabitants
left to give us food and drinks as we had
had before at every resting place, which helped
us greatly. Along the roadside lots of trees had
been smashed by shell fire, and there were hundreds
of graves with rough crosses or little flags
to mark them, and every now and then we passed
a broken auto or a dead horse lying in the gutter.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifth day we got our first sample
of war&mdash;quite suddenly, without any warning,
as we didn't know we were near the firing line.
We had just entered a devastated village when
there came a shrill whistling noise like when white
hot iron is plunged into cold water, then a terrific
bang as a shell burst about thirty yards in
front of our columns, making a hole in the road
about five feet deep and ten in diameter, and sending
a hail of shrapnel in all directions. One big
splinter hit a man in the second rank and took his
head off&mdash;I think he was a Norwegian; anyway,
that was our first casualty. No one else was injured.</p>

<p>Our boys took their baptism of fire pretty
coolly, though most of us jumped at the bang and
ducked involuntarily to dodge the shrapnel, which,
by the way, isn't very dangerous at more than
thirty yards, though it does a lot of harm at
shorter range. Personally, I wasn't as scared as
I expected, and most of the others said the same.
At first, one is too interested to be frightened, and
by the time the novelty has worn off one has gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fairly used to it all&mdash;at least that seemed to
be our general opinion.</p>

<p>There were no more shells after that one, and
we continued our march till nightfall, when we
camped in an abandoned village. Next morning
there were 100 big auto trucks ready to take us
to a point about forty miles along the lines, and we
clambered aboard them and set off at a good
speed&mdash;all but twenty unlucky lads, who were left
to pad the hoof as a guard for our mules and baggage.
My pal, William Thaw, was among the
number; he marched for thirteen hours practically
without a stop, and when he reached our
camp he lay right down in the mud by the roadside
and went straight off to sleep, though it was raining
like sixty and he was drenched to the skin.
But he was all right again in the morning, though
it was a man's job to wake him up.</p>

<p>Next day we set off before dawn, having received
orders to take our place in the trenches
about eight miles away. It soon got light, and
after marching about half an hour we were unlucky
enough to be seen by a German aeroplane
which signaled us to their batteries. The first
shell burst near, the second nearer, the third right
among us, killing nearly a dozen old-timers; and
we were forced to break ranks and take cover
until nightfall, as they'd got the range and it
would have been suicide to try and go on. Pretty
good shooting that at five or six miles' distance!</p>

<p>The French talk a lot about their artillery, but,
believe me, the Dutchies are mighty fine gunners,
especially with their cannon&mdash;even the very biggest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>No Chance to Rest.</i></h3>

<p>Why, one day when my company was having its
usual weekly rest from the trenches, there were a
couple of hundred of us bunking in a big barn fully
eight miles behind our lines. About three in the
afternoon along came a German aeroplane, and
half an hour later they dropped a couple of shells
between the barn and a church some thirty yards
farther back, just by way of showing what they
could do. We thought that was all, and settled
down comfortably for the night; but not a bit of
it! At ten o'clock sharp a shell dropped plump
onto the barn itself and killed five or six and
wounded a dozen more, none of them Americans.
We got out on the jump, though of course it was
raining; and we were wise, for in the next half
hour they hit the barn eleven times without a
single miss, and at ten-thirty there weren't any
big enough bits of it left to make matches of. The
barn was perhaps thirty yards long by fifteen
wide, but remember they were firing at a range of
ten miles or so and in pitch darkness. Of course,
they had got their guns trained right in the afternoon
and just waited till night to give us a pleasant
surprise. I did hear those were Austrian
mortars, not German; anyway, they were good
enough for us, I can tell you.</p>

<p>But to go back to my story: We broke ranks
and fled to cover, and remained in hiding all that
day near a ruined farm with shells falling all
about, though they didn't do much damage. But
our old-timers didn't like it one little bit. They
had not been used to that kind of thing in Africa,
and then the Germans and Austrians didn't at all
fancy the idea of being fired upon by their own
people. In our company all of the Sergeants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
most of the other non-coms were Austrian&mdash;not
that they turned out later to be any the worse
fighters for that. There was one Sergeant named
Wiedmann who fought like a lion; he was the
bravest man in the regiment. Poor chap, I've just
heard he was killed the other day by a hand
grenade, and I'm sorry. He was a real white man
if ever I knew one. Our Lieutenant was a German
named Bloch, and only the Captain was a Frenchman.
But all this mixture of races led to some
rather curious results, as the following story will
show:</p>


<h3><i>"The Corsican Brothers."</i></h3>

<p>Among the recruits who joined us at Paris there
were two young fellows from Corsica&mdash;the Corsican
brothers, we called them, as they always stuck
together&mdash;who said they belonged to the Corsican
militia, but preferred to volunteer, as they wanted
to see some fighting right away. Besides French,
they spoke English fluently, and used to jabber
away together in some local patois, but they were
both very smart soldiers and were soon promoted
Corporals and got along fine. Every one liked
them, and they stood very well with the officers as
well. After we had been in the trenches about ten
days these two chaps disappeared one wet night
and left behind a note for the Colonel, which I
was lucky enough to see. It ran something like
this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Most Honored Sir:
</p>

<p>Though we have spent a most agreeable time in
your regiment&mdash;of which we have a good opinion,
although the discipline is sometimes rather more
lax than we are accustomed to&mdash;we feel that the
moment has come for us to join our friends, which
we were unable to do at the mobilization, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
naturally preferred the Foreign Legion to a concentration
camp.</p>

<p>We will give a good account of you to our
friends and hope to have the pleasure of meeting
you again before long.</p>

<p class="sig1 noind">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Otto X&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Ober-Lieutenant, Potsdam Guards.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Hermann Y&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Lieutenant, Potsdam Guards.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Wouldn't that fease you? The Colonel nearly
blew up.</p>

<p>Well, at nightfall we resumed our march by
separate companies. Our Captain didn't know
the country, so of course we got lost. It was
raining heavily, and the mud was frequently knee
deep. Add to that incessant tumbles into numberless
shell holes full of water, and you will realize
that we were a pretty sad procession that finally
at three A. M. scrambled into the stinking ditch
where we were to spend the greater part of the
next three months.</p>

<p>For three or four days we had nothing to do but
dodge the shrapnel and try and keep warm, as the
enemy maintained a constant artillery fire&mdash;with
a regular interval for luncheon&mdash;starting about
six A. M. and stopping toward five P. M.; and they
got the range. I tell you, one lies pretty flat when
there's any shrapnel about. Some of the English
boys were killed the second day, but we Americans
have been fine and lucky&mdash;only one killed the
whole time, though we have had some very narrow
shaves. For instance, Thaw had his bayonet
knocked off his rifle by a "sniper" while on sentry-go,
and another boy named Merlac had his
pipe taken clean out of his mouth by a shrapnel
ball in the trenches. It didn't hurt him at all, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
I never saw any one look so surprised in my life.
Shortly afterward Jimmy Bach (who is now in
the Aviation Corps with Thaw and me) had his
head cut by a rifle bullet which just grazed it
without doing more than make a deepish scratch.
I myself had a close squeak the very day of our
arrival in the trenches. A piece of shell weighing
three or four pounds smashed to bits the pack on
my back&mdash;including my best pipe, which I couldn't
replace until I got back to Paris&mdash;without so much
as bruising me, though it scared me something
dreadful.</p>


<h3><i>Farewell, Whiskers!</i></h3>

<p>Our company had an eight days' "shift" in the
trenches, followed by three days' rest at a camp
four miles in the rear.</p>

<p>During the week's duty it was impossible to
wash or take off one's clothes, and we quickly got
into a horrible condition of filth. To begin with,
there was a cake of mud from head to foot about
half an inch thick; but what was worse was the
vermin which infested our clothes almost immediately
and were practically impossible to get rid
of. They nearly broke the heart of Lieutenant
Bloch. He had a wonderful crop of bright red
whiskers, of which he was as proud as a kitten
with its first mouse, because he thought they gave
him a really warlike appearance, and he was always
combing them and squinting at them in a
little pocket mirror. Well, one day the lice got
into these whiskers and fairly gave him hades. He
bore it for a week, scratching away at his chin
until he was tearing out chunks of hair by the
roots; but at last he could stand no more, and had
to have the whole lot shaved off. He was the saddest
thing you ever saw after that, with a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
chinless face like a pink rabbit, and was so
ashamed he hardly dared show himself in daylight.</p>

<p>But mud and vermin were only minor worries,
really; our proper serious troubles were cold and
hunger. It's pretty cool in the middle of France
toward the end of November, and for some reason&mdash;I
guess because they were such a lot of infernal
thieves at our depot&mdash;we never got any of the
clothes and warm wraps sent up from Paris for
us. It was just throwing money away to try it.
My wife mailed me three or four lots of woolen
sweaters and underclothes, but I never received
a single thing, and the rest of the boys had much
the same experience.</p>


<h3><i>Running the Gauntlet.</i></h3>

<p>That was bad, but the hunger was something
fierce. The Foreign Legion is not particularly
well fed at any time&mdash;coffee and dry bread for
breakfast, soup with lumps of meat in it for luncheon,
with rice to follow, and the same plus coffee
for dinner, and not too much of anything, either.
But in our case all the grub had to be brought in
buckets from the relief post, four miles away, by
squads leaving the trenches at three A. M., ten
A. M., and five P. M., and a tough job it was, what
with the darkness and the mud and the shell holes
and the German cannonade, to say nothing of occasional
snipers taking pot shots at you with
rifles. I got one bullet once right between my
legs, which drilled a hole in the next bucket in
line and wasted all our coffee.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, quite a lot of the stuff
used to get spilt on the way, and then the boys
carrying it used to scrape it up off the ground and
put it back again, so that nearly everything one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ate was full of gravel and, of course, absolutely
cold. More than once when the cannonade was
especially violent we got nothing to eat all day
but a couple of little old sardines; and, believe
me, it takes a mighty strong stomach to stand that
sort of treatment for any length of time. As far
as we Americans were concerned, who were mostly
accustomed to man-sized meals, the net result
was literally slow starvation.</p>


<h3><i>Repulsed With Loss.</i></h3>

<p>The second night in the trenches we had an
alarm of a night attack. I crept out to a "funk-hole"
some thirty yards ahead of our trench with
a couple of friends. It was nearly ten o'clock
and there was a thin drizzle. We stared out into
the darkness, breathing hard in our excitement.
The usual fireworks display of searchlights and
rockets over the German trenches was missing&mdash;an
invariable sign of a contemplated attack, we
had been told. Suddenly I glimpsed a line of dim
figures advancing slowly through the darkness.
"Hold your fire, boys," I gasped. "Let them get
good and close before you loose off." They came
nearer, stealthily, silently. We raised our rifles.
Suddenly my friend on the right rolled over, shaking
with noiseless laughter. For a moment we
thought he was mad. Then we, too, realized the
truth. The approaching column, instead of eager,
bloodthirsty Germans, was a dozen harmless domestic
cows, strays, doubtless, from a deserted
farm. There were considerable casualties among
the attacking force, and for a week at least the
American section of the Foreign Legion had an
ample diet.</p>

<p>The next night the three of us were out there
again, but there was still no attack, though we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rather a nasty experience all the same. We were
crawling back to our trench about midnight when
suddenly we found ourselves under a heavy fire.
One bullet went through Thaw's kepi, but we soon
saw that instead of coming from the Germans, the
fire was directed from a section of our own
trenches who thought there was an attack. We
yelled, but they went on shooting. I was so mad
that I shot back at them, but luckily there was no
damage done anywhere.</p>


<h3><i>Praise for Germans.</i></h3>

<p>Two nights later there really did come an attack
in considerable force. A lot of us crawled
out into a hollow in front of our trench and, starting
at about forty yards' distance, we let them
have it hot and heavy. We had our bayonets
fixed, but they didn't get near enough to charge.
I think we kept up America's reputation for
marksmanship; anyway, they melted away after
about half an hour, and in the morning there were
several hundred dead bodies in front of the trench&mdash;they
had taken the wounded back with them.
The bodies were still there when I left, nearly
three months later. I crawled out a night or two
afterward and had a look at them, and was lucky
enough to get an iron cross as a souvenir off a
young officer. He was lying flat on his back with a
hole between the eyes, and he had the horriblest
grin human face ever wore; his lips were drawn
right back off the teeth so that he seemed to be
snarling like a wild beast ready to bite.</p>

<p>We took no prisoners at all; in fact, none of
them got near enough, and our Colonel didn't
think it worth while risking a counter-charge. To
tell the truth, we hardly took any prisoners any
time, except here and there an occasional straggler.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I've heard stories about the Dutchies surrendering
easily, but you can take it from me
that's all bunk. I used to think that one Irishman
could lick seventeen Dutchmen; but, believe me,
when they get that old uniform on they are a very
different proposition. On one occasion a company
of the Legion surrounded a Lieutenant and
eleven men. They called on them to surrender,
but not a bit of it. They held out all day and
fought to the last gasp. At last only the Lieutenant
and one soldier were left alive, both
wounded. Again they refused to give in, and
they had to kill the Lieutenant before the last survivor
finally threw down his rifle and let them
carry him off. I heard he died on the way to the
station, and I'm mighty sorry; he was a white
man, if he was a German.</p>

<p>One remarkable thing about the prisoners we
did get was their exceedingly thorough knowledge
of everything going on, not only of the war in
general, but of all that was taking place back of
our trenches. Their spy system is something marvelous.
Why, they knew the exact date our reinforcements
were coming on one occasion nearly a
week beforehand, when the majority of our fellows
hadn't even an idea there were any expected!</p>

<p>In some cases they got information from French
villagers whom they had bought before they retreated.
I saw one such case myself. We were
bivouacked in a ruined village, and a lot of us
were sleeping in and around a cottage that hadn't
been damaged. We were downstairs, while the
owner of the cottage and his wife and kid had the
upstairs room. One of our boys happened to go
outside in the night and, by jingo! he saw the fellow
coolly signaling with a lamp behind his curtain.
He went along and told the Captain, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was at the schoolhouse, and they came back with
a couple of under officers and arrested them red-handed.
He tried to hide under the bed, and
howled for mercy when they pulled him out. His
wife never turned a hair&mdash;the Sergeant told me
she looked as if she was glad he'd been caught.
They shot him there and then in his own yard, and
his wife was around in the morning just as if
nothing had happened.</p>


<h3><i>"Pluckiest Thing in the War."</i></h3>

<p>After that we always used to be very suspicious
of any house or village that wasn't devastated
when everything round had been chewed up; there
was nearly always a spy concealed somewhere not
far off. To give you a case in point: There was a
fine big château near Craonelle, where our
trenches were, that hadn't been bombarded,
though they had stripped most of the furniture
and stuff out of it. Well, one fine day the General
commanding our section thought it would be a
convenient place to hold a big pow-wow. He and
his staff had only been seated at the table about
ten minutes when a whacking great 310-millimeter
shell burst right on top of the darned place, followed
by a perfect hail of others. The General
and his staff ran for their lives; luckily none of
them were badly hurt, though they got the deuce
of a scare.</p>

<p>After the bombardment some of us went along
to look at what was left of the château, and&mdash;will
you believe me?&mdash;we found a little old Dutch
sous-off half choked in the cellar, but still hanging
on to the business end of a telephone. I call that
the pluckiest thing I've seen at the war, and I can
tell you we were mighty sorry to have to shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
him. He never turned a hair, either, and we
didn't even suggest bandaging his eyes. He knew
what was coming to him from the start; that he
was as good as a dead man from the moment he
got into the cellar. He told us he had been there
a week, just waiting for some confiding bunch of
French officers to come along and hold a meeting.</p>

<p>It's funny how some men meet death, anyway.
We had one nigger prize fighter along with us
named Bob Scanlon. He was the blackest coon
you ever saw, until one day there came a great big
"marmite" that burst almost on top of him and
buried him in the mud. We dug him out, and he
wasn't even scratched, but ever afterward he has
been a kind of mulatto color, he was so darned
scared by the narrowness of his escape.</p>


<h3><i>Good Way to Die.</i></h3>

<p>Another boy, an Englishman, got out of the
trench one day to stretch his legs, as he said he
was tired of sitting still. Some one called to him
to come down and not be a fool, as the Germans
were keeping up a constant rifle fire, and after a
minute or two he jumped back into the trench.
"They didn't get you, did they?" called out some
one. "Oh, no!" he answered, sitting down. Then
all of a sudden he just keeled over slowly sideways
without a sound, and, believe me, when they went
to pick him up he was as dead as David&mdash;plugged
clean through the heart. He never even felt the
shock of it. If they do ever get me, that's the way
I hope to die.</p>

<h2><a name="FRENCHMAN_MEETS_THAT_STRANGE_BEING" id="FRENCHMAN_MEETS_THAT_STRANGE_BEING">FRENCHMAN MEETS THAT STRANGE BEING,
TOMMY ATKINS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">LATTER'S UN-FRENCH WAYS AMUSINGLY DEPICTED BY
PARISIAN JOURNALIST FOR HIS READERS.</p>


<p>The thousands of English soldiers now on
French soil are, to Frenchmen, strange, exotic
creatures, the study of which is full of delightful
surprises. Recently a French journalist traveled
to the trenches, interviewed several specimens of
the genus Tommy Atkins, and published the results
in a Paris newspaper.</p>

<p>One Tommy was "of the species crane," with
thin legs and arms like telegraph wires, by no
means as taciturn as the Frenchman had believed
Englishmen to be. He told the Frenchman some
tall yarns.</p>

<p>"In one fight our battalion lost five hundred
men," he vouchsafed. "One bullet, which just
scratched my nose, killed my pal beside me."</p>

<p>Another Tommy dwelt on the awful fact that he
had been "twenty-two days on water without any
tea in it." He, too, had been in the thick of the
fray and had killed several of the enemy with his
own hand, which, recounts the Frenchman, filled
him with "a gentle joy."</p>

<p>"Are the inhabitants of this part of France
hospitable?" the journalist inquired of another
Englishman.</p>

<p>"Awfully nice!" replied the soldier. These
words the correspondent, after giving them in
English, to show how strange they look, translates:
"Terriblement aimable"&mdash;a combination
which must appear perfectly incomprehensible to
Frenchmen, who do not see how a thing can be
"awful" and "nice" at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At a village in Northern France the newspaper
man found some English soldiers instructing a lot
of village boys in the rudiments of football.</p>

<p>"When the French team scored a point," he
writes, "I said to one of the Englishmen: 'But
aren't you ashamed to let them beat you at your
own game?' To which the Briton replied: 'Ah,
but we want to encourage the people of France to
take up sports!'"</p>

<p>Football was being played wherever there were
Englishmen. Often the games were between teams
of English and French soldiers. Where a ball
was not to be had, the players were quite content
to kick about a bundle of clothes.</p>

<p>When not thus engaged, the English soldier
finds time to enter the lists of Cupid. The French
writer tells of one Tommy whom he saw "promenading
proudly before the awe-struck glances of
the villagers with three girls on his arm!"</p>

<p>"The English? Oh, they're good fellows!" remarked
a villager in whose house a number of the
allies of France were quartered. "They're in
bed snoring every night at eight. They get together
in my kitchen while I make their tea and
sing sentimental songs. They're all musical."
The journalist adds, in corroboration of this statement,
that he himself heard Tommies "singing
discordantly to the accompaniment of the cannon."</p>

<p>Also he found that Tommy had a sense of humor.
On one occasion, he learned, a German officer
came charging at the head of his men into an
English trench. Leaping over the edge of it, he
fell headlong into a sea of black mud, from which
he picked himself up, black and dripping, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a confounded nuisance this old war is,
isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon a Tommy, about to run his bayonet
through the intruder, burst into roars of laughter,
and made him a prisoner instead.</p>

<p>"And the Tommies are philosophers, too,"
writes the Frenchman. "I heard one of them say
solemnly to a comrade: 'If you have any money,
spend it all to-day. You may be dead to-morrow!'"</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_YOUNG_SOLDIER_WHO_PROVED_A" id="ONE_YOUNG_SOLDIER_WHO_PROVED_A">ONE YOUNG SOLDIER WHO PROVED A
HERO.</a></h2>


<p>"Jean Berger, 'simple soldat' of the Second
Regiment of Infantry, should, after the war, be
Jean Berger, V. C. He is a Frenchman&mdash;yes; but
listen to this story:</p>

<p>"He, a boy of about eighteen years of age, lies
in hospital here, wounded badly, but not dangerously,
in the side and also in the hand.</p>

<p>"Jean belongs to an old Alsatian family. After
the war against Prussia, his grandfather refused
to submit to the rule of the conquerors, and left
the province to settle in Normandy. He passed
his hatred of the Prussians on to his son, and the
son instilled it in the four grandchildren.</p>

<p>"When war broke out, two of the sons were already
in the army, one as an officer, and the
father, calling to him the two boys who were not
yet of age to be called upon by the military authorities,
said to them: 'Go and enlist! And be
sure to join regiments which will operate on the
Alsatian frontier.'</p>

<p>"Jean joined the Second Regiment of Infantry,
which was soon under orders for Upper Alsace.
Before it arrived at the scene of operations, however,
fresh instructions were received, and the
Second went to operate with the English on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
left. He went through the terrible ordeal of the
battle of the Marne, and, with his regiment, now
sadly diminished in numbers, but with its dash
and spirit as of old, he formed one of the stupendous
line drawn up to face the Germans in their
tremendously strong positions on the Aisne.</p>

<p>"It was during one of the almost innumerable
fights which, battles in themselves, are making up
that Homeric struggle of the nations on the River
Aisne that the Colonel leading the gallant Second
was shot down. Machine guns were raking the
quickly thrown-up trenches; showers of rifle bullets
were falling everywhere around. With that
heroism which takes account of nothing save the
object in view, Jean rushed out of his shelter to
carry his Colonel to safety.</p>

<p>"Through a rain of leaden death he passed
scatheless, reached his Colonel, and carried him to
safety.</p>


<h3><i>Back Through Hail of Lead.</i></h3>

<p>"As he was performing his glorious act, he
passed an officer of the Grenadier Guards
wounded severely in the leg who called out for
water.</p>

<p>"'All right!' cried Jean. 'I'll be back in a minute
or two.'</p>

<p>"He put the Colonel in the shelter of a trench
where the Red Cross men were at work, procured
some wine from one of the doctors, and set forth
again to face the bullet showers. And again he
went out untouched.</p>

<p>"Reaching the English officer, Jean held up the
flask to the wounded man's lips, but, before he
could drink, a bullet struck the young Frenchman
in the hand, carrying away three fingers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
flask fell to the ground. Quickly, as though the
flask had merely slipped out of one hand by accident,
Jean picked it up with the other; and, supported
by the young Frenchman, the English officer
drank.</p>

<p>"While he was doing so, a bullet drilled Jean
through the side. Yet, in spite of the intense pain,
he managed to take off his knapsack, and, searching
in it, discovered some food, which he gave to
his English comrade.</p>

<p>"'But what about you, yourself?' asked the
officer.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' replied Jean brightly, 'it's not long
since I had a good meal!'</p>

<p>"As the Guardsman was eating, he and Jean
discovered that near them was a wounded German
soldier, who, recovering from the delirium of
wounds, was crying out for food and drink. The
Englishman, taking the flask, which had still some
wine in it, and also the remainder of the food from
the Frenchman's knapsack, managed, though suffering
great pain, to roll himself along till he
reached the spot where the German soldier lay.
There, however, he found he was, by himself, too
weak to give the poor fellow anything.</p>

<p>"So he shouted to Jean to come to his assistance,
and, though movement could only be at the
cost of great pain, the young Frenchman managed,
too, to reach the place, and together, Englishman
and Frenchman, succored the dying German.
One held him up while the other poured
wine between his parched lips.</p>


<h3><i>All Fall in a Heap.</i></h3>

<p>"Then human nature could stand no more, and
all three fell, utterly exhausted, in a heap together.
All through the long night, a night continuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
broken by the roar of cannon, death
watched over that strange sleeping place of the
three comrades of three great warring nations.</p>

<p>"In the morning, shells bursting near them
aroused the English officer and the French soldier.
Their German neighbor was dead, and for a long
time they could only wonder how the day of battle
was going. When the forenoon was well advanced,
they saw Germans advancing.</p>

<p>"Jean, who can speak German, called out: 'We
are thirsty; please give us something to drink.'
He was heard by some officer of Uhlans, who rode
up, and, dismounting and covering them with his
revolver, asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>"'We are thirsty,' replied Jean.</p>

<p>"The German looked at the little group. He
saw his countryman lying dead with an empty
flask beside him, and guessed what was the scene
of comradeship and bravery which the spot had
witnessed. He gave instructions to an orderly,
and wine was brought and given to the two
wounded men. Surely that is a scene and a deed
which will wipe out many a bitter thought and
memory of war!</p>

<p>"Just then the cannonade burst forth again
with tremendous fury, and the German force
which had come up had to retire. Shells were
soon bursting all around, and fragments struck
the English officer. He became delirious with
pain, and the young Frenchman&mdash;stiff, feverish,
and weak himself&mdash;saw that it was necessary to
do something to bring the officer to a place where
he would be safe and would receive attention.</p>

<p>"Jean tried to lift the Englishman, but found
that he had not sufficient strength left to take his
comrade on his shoulder. So, half lifting him,
and dragging and rolling him at times, the gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
little piou-piou brought the wounded English
officer nearer and nearer to safety and help. The
journey was two miles long! * * * But at
last it was over."</p>


<h3><i>May Get Victoria Cross.</i></h3>

<p>"The two men came upon some trenches occupied
by the allied forces; they were recognized
and taken in charge by an officer of the English
Red Cross. They had both just enough strength
left to shake hands and say good-by.</p>

<p>"'If I live through this,' said the officer of the
Guards, 'I shall do my best to get you the British
Victoria Cross. I've your number and that of
your regiment. God bless you, mon camarade!'
And the Guardsman lost consciousness.</p>

<p>"Jean Berger lies in hospital here in Angers;
he is expected to recover.</p>

<p>"That is the story; and that is why I believe
that England will think that Jean Berger, 'simple
soldat' of the Second Regiment of Infantry,
should become Jean Berger, V. C.</p>

<p>"For the two nations have become one by blood
shed and bravery displayed, and, in addition, a
little incident which I can relate will show that
there is a precedent for a union of honors as there
is evidence of a complete union of hearts.</p>

<p>"In the British Expeditionary Force there is an
English soldier, a member of a cyclist corps, who
is proud to wear upon his breast the 'médaille
militaire' of the French Army.</p>

<p>"The story of the stirring incident has been
told to me by Henri Roger, a young soldier of
the Fifth Infantry who saw it from the trenches
and who is now lying wounded in hospital here.</p>

<p>"During one of the engagements last week on
the River Aisne, the Fifth was holding an intrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
position and was faced in the distance by
a strong force of the enemy. To the right and
left of the opposing forces were large clumps of
trees, in one of which a force of English troops
had taken up a position, a fact regarding which
the Germans were unaware. In the other wood,
it was soon discovered, lay a considerable body of
German infantry with several machine gun sections.</p>


<h3><i>Cyclist Wins Decoration.</i></h3>

<p>"A road ran beside the wood in which the enemy
lay hidden, and along it a force of French infantry
was seen to be advancing. How were they
to be saved from the ambush into which they were
marching? That was the problem, and it was a
difficult one.</p>

<p>"Every time the French troops in the trenches
endeavored to signal to their oncoming comrades
hidden German sharpshooters picked off the signalers.
Soon the position seemed to be almost
desperate; every moment the intrenched French
soldiers expected to hear the hideous swish of the
Maxims mowing down their unsuspecting comrades.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, however, something happened
which attracted the attention of the French and
German trenches. From the wood where the English
lay hidden a cyclist dashed&mdash;the English, too,
had seen the danger, and a cyclist had been ordered
to carry a message of warning to the advancing
French column, several hundreds strong.</p>

<p>"The cyclist bent low in his saddle and darted
forward; he had not gone a hundred yards before
he fell, killed by a well-aimed German bullet. A
minute later another cyclist appeared, only, in
a second or two, to share his comrade's fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then a third&mdash;the thing had to be done! The
bullets whizzed round him, but on he went over
the fire-swept zone. The Frenchmen held their
breath as they watched the gallant cyclist speeding
toward the French column; puffs of smoke
from the wood where the Germans were showed
that the sharpshooters were redoubling their efforts.
But the cyclist held on and soon passed
beyond some high ground where he was sheltered
from the Germans, but could still be seen by the
intrenched French.</p>

<p>"The Frenchmen could not resist a loud 'Hurrah!'
when they saw the daring cyclist dismount
on reaching the officer in command of the troops
which he had dared death to save.</p>

<p>"The officer heard the message and took in the
position at a glance. He gave an order or two
instantly, and turned to the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Then there was a fine but simple battle picture
which should live.</p>

<p>"The deed which had saved hundreds of lives
was one of those which bring glory as of old back
to the horror of modern warfare. Courage, and
courage alone, had triumphed, unsupported by
any of the murderous machinery of the armies of
to-day.</p>

<p>"That was what the French officer recognized.
He saluted the gallant fellow standing by the
cycle. Then, with a simple movement, took the
'médaille militaire'&mdash;the Victoria Cross of France&mdash;from
his own tunic and pinned it on the coat of
the Englishman.</p>

<p>"'I am glad,' young Roger told me when he
had finished relating the story, 'to have lived to
see that deed. It was glorious!'"</p>

<h2><a name="DR" id="DR"></a>DR. MARY CRAWFORD OF BROOKLYN
TELLS OF AMERICAN AMBULANCE
WORK IN A PARIS HOSPITAL.</h2>

<p class="center">TRAGEDY AND HUMOR MIXED.</p>


<p>Dr. Mary Merritt Crawford, who in 1907 became
widely known as Brooklyn's first woman
ambulance surgeon, and who has established for
herself since that time an enviable reputation in
the medical profession, served in the American
Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly-Sur-Seine under
Dr. du Bouchet and Dr. Joseph Blake. Her letters
recounting her experiences among the wounded
describe in the most graphic manner the terrible
nature of the wounds inflicted in modern warfare.</p>

<p>She writes:</p>

<p>"We have been getting so many men with
frozen feet from the trenches. They have had
much snow near Ypres, they say, and the cold is
terrible. Last night one poor Frenchman, who
had been in the trenches for several weeks before
he was wounded, was told he would be sent away
to-morrow. His regiment is still up north and he
would be sent there. He went almost mad with
despair and tried to kill himself. This is the only
case I've come directly in contact with, although
I've heard of others. I wonder there aren't more.
Most of the little 'piou-pious' take it with wonderful
stoicism. It is fate, and they accept it, but
no one wants to go back to trench fighting. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
don't blame them for anything they do. Human
flesh and blood cannot stand it beyond a certain
point."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Two days ago we had a poor wretch admitted,
who had, by actual count, 150 shrapnel wounds on
him. You never saw anything so ghastly as he
was. The shell had burst so close that all his hair
was singed, and he was literally peppered with
pieces of shell. He died to-night and I couldn't
help but be glad a little, for his suffering would
have been so awful and long-drawn out had he
lived.</p>

<p>"To-day I'm dismissing one of my little zou-zous
(Zouaves). He gave me one of his buttons
as a souvenir, and when I gave him 2 francs he
wouldn't take it until I told him to keep it as a
souvenir, not as money. Then he did finally consent.
He had to go out in the same dirty uniform,
all blood-stained and with the bullet hole in his
coat. The French Government is making the
gray-blue clothes as fast as possible. I've seen
a number when walking in Paris. They are the
same cut as before, not as trim and compact as
our service clothes, but the men inside are splendid,
and as patients, ideal."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><i>A Dog That Saved His Master.</i></h3>

<p>"I must write you just one story that came to
me at the ambulance just before Christmas, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
though it is a little late. We had a French soldier
brought in frightfully wounded. He came from
the region around St. Mihiel. One leg had to be
amputated, and, besides that, he had half a dozen
other wounds. His dog came with him&mdash;hunting
dog of some kind. This dog had saved his master's
life. They were in the trenches together,
when a shell burst in such a way as to collapse
the whole trench. Every one in it was killed or
buried in the collapse, and this dog dug and dug
until he got his master's face free, so that he
could breathe, and then he sat by him until some
reinforcements came and dug them all out. Every
one was dead but this man. We have both the dog
and the man with us. The dog has a little house
all to himself in the court, and he has blankets and
lots of petting, and every day he is allowed to be
with his master for a little while."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I am very tired to-night. For some time now
I've had charge of the dental cases, in addition to
my regular work. Just now I have nine of them.
They are the men who have fractures of the upper
or lower jaws besides other wounds. The American
dentists here are doing wonderful work&mdash;some
of the most brilliant that is done in any department.
Such deformities you never saw. The
whole front of one man's face is gone, and how
we are going to build him a new one I don't see,
but as soon as he is ready we'll begin grafting and
plastic work generally. One of these men is a
black boy, the saddest figure in the whole hospital
to me. His identification tag was lost in transit.
He doesn't read or write or speak a word of
French and none of our Senegalesi, Moroccans,
Algerians, or Tunisians can talk to him. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
utterly alone and lost. In the course of time the
Government will place him, but it will be a long
process. His wound is ghastly. The bullet hit his
front teeth, but as his lips must have been drawn
back in a snarl or laugh at the time, no wound appears
there. The whole of his left upper and
lower teeth were blown out, upper and lower jaw
fractured and literally his whole left cheek blown
away. You can put your fingers right into his
mouth from just in front of his ear and see the
inner side of his lips. It is awful taking care of
him, but he is as patient as some poor dog who
knows you are trying to help him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Next week I am going to have all my jaw cases
photographed together. Their deformities are
frightful, but they are cheery. One man whose
whole front face is almost gone is now radiant.
You see he couldn't smoke because he couldn't
suck in the air, having no upper teeth or lip. Well,
the dentists built him a kind of 'false front' of
soft rubber, and now he is 'très gentil,' as he says,
and can smoke nicely. My poor black boy is much
better. Dr. Blake did a marvelous operation on
his face and closed in most of the gap. Suddenly
to-day we discovered he was talking French. Before
he wouldn't say a word&mdash;couldn't, poor fellow!&mdash;and
seemed not to understand. He says
his name is Hramess ben something or other. Also
he says that he fought for three days with that
ghastly, blown-to-pieces face, and didn't give up until
he got the bullet in his back. Did I tell you we
got the bullet out, and he has it as a souvenir? He
nearly died of mortification because we had thought
he was a Senegalesi&mdash;he is so dark. He says he
is an Algerian, and has told us his regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must finish this letter with an attempted account
of our wonderful fête de Noël, which was
held here this afternoon [this letter was written
on Christmas Eve], and which will terminate at
midnight with a mass in the chapel. A famous
opera singer is to sing Gounod's 'Ave Maria,'
and I'm going to prop open my weary eyes and
attend it.</p>

<p>"We decorated the wards and halls with holly
and mistletoe, which grows in great abundance
and richness here in France. We had the tree all
lighted by electric bulbs downstairs, with a beautiful
Santa Claus giving out gifts. All walking
cases filed in and received small gifts. Many came
in chairs, too. Meantime a trained chorus was
walking through the halls from floor to floor, singing
Christmas carols, and finally Santa Claus carried
his gifts to all the bed patients. In the meanwhile
the chapel was filled with soldiers and
nurses, and many patriotic songs were sung. The
singing made me so homesick that the tears came
and I had to go back to my sick men. I bought
each man a package of cigarettes and a box of
matches, and I gave an enlargement of the group
photo I sent you to each man in it. Also I lent
them my big silk American flag to help decorate.</p>


<h3><i>The Clown of the Hospital.</i></h3>

<p>"Ahmed, the big Turco, who came to me with
seven shrapnel wounds, but is now almost well,
and who I told you is the proud husband of two
wives and the father of six sons&mdash;he does not
count the daughters&mdash;got hold of the flag somehow,
and now it hangs proudly over his bed. By
the way, he heard this morning that one of his
wives, Fatima, has presented him with a son, so
now he has seven. Such joy! While I was down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at noon buying the tobacco and a few little things
for K&mdash;&mdash; I saw a little doll, chocolate in color,
dressed as a baby. I bought it and put it on Ahmed's
pillow when he wasn't looking. The instant
he spied it he let off a yell: 'Mon fils de Tunis!'
and hugged that poupée and carried on most delightfully.</p>

<p>"I also bought a wooden crane, whose head,
neck, and feet move, for Moosa, the black Senegalesi.
I told you about him a long time ago, but
not by name. He is the one who said a prayer
over his wound and tried to bite every one who
came near him. He has become quite tame under
the influence of Dr. Chauneau, who is the most
charming old Frenchman imaginable. Moosa got
toys exactly like a child and was just as delighted.
He laughs just like a typical Southern darky does,
and is altogether funny. They keep him in a red
jacket and cap, and the color effect is splendid.
It reminds me of chocolate and strawberry ice
cream.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"That Turco, Ahmed, whom I've spoken of several
times, and who is absolutely devoted to me,
keeps the ward in a perfect gale. Last night the
men had a regular circus there, and it was all
fomented by that old rascal. I've told you how
he insists on calling me 'maman' and is jealous as
a spoiled child if I show any extra attention to
any of the other patients in the ward. Well, last
night old Ahmed was very much excited when I
came in after supper. He has learned some English,
which he now mixes with his French and
Arabic. When I asked him what was the trouble
he said: 'Spik, maman?' meaning might he talk.
I graciously gave him permission, whereupon he
burst into burning speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"He said they were all French, both Arabs and
Frenchmen, and the English were their allies,
weren't they? Yes. They were all wounded?
Yes. All in the same cause? Yes. Some had
more than one wound; he had seven? Yes. Then
why weren't they all fed alike? Why should Risbourg
sit in bed, never walking, never going to the
table to eat&mdash;in fact, never doing any of the things
they all had to do&mdash;and yet have extra feeding?
You see, Risbourg is the case I told you of that
nearly died of hemorrhage from a small arm
wound. He had to be transfused and he is on
extra feeding to make up his blood. He does eat
enormously, and I love to see him do it.</p>

<p>"Well, I noticed that Risbourg was the only one
who wasn't laughing, so I called Ahmed to attention
and told him the story of the hemorrhage,
whereupon he gave me a huge wink to show that
it was all a joke. Risbourg didn't regard it as
such, so I went over and told him that I understood,
and that I wanted him to eat as much as he
wanted, and that it was all right. He is really
very devoted to me, and said: 'You, doctor, you
understand, but all the time Ahmed tells the nurse
to tell you that I eat too much.'</p>

<p>"By this time they were all crowding around
him trying to make up, and he added: 'I know
why they say such things! It is because I am of
the infantry of France, and they are zouaves and
tirailleurs (artillerymen) of Africa. I am alone
among them.'</p>

<p>"Well, this was getting serious, so I made a
speech and told them they were all Frenchmen
and brothers, and we all 'vived la France!' Then
Old Incorrigible had to pipe up again: 'Mais,
maman, Risbourg said I didn't smell good. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he spat when I said I was a Frenchman. And also
he said he was a German.'</p>

<p>"I said: 'Risbourg, did you tell him you were
a German?' Risbourg smiled broadly (he has one
tooth gone just like Dave Warfield) and said:
'Yes, doctor, but because the Irish boy told me to.
Je fais une plaisance.' So then I pointed out to
him that he had had his little joke, and Ahmed
had had his, when he said that he ate too much.
Great applause from the Arabs, who quickly got
the ethical point. So we all made up and shook
hands."</p>

<p>The following letter, written by Prince Joachim
of Prussia, the youngest son of the German Emperor,
was addressed to a wounded comrade in
arms by the Prince, himself at that time recovering
from a wound suffered in battle. Prince
Joachim, who is 24 years old, is a Lieutenant in
the First Prussian Infantry Guards. In a tone of
easy-going comradeship, not usually associated
with the stern and imperious Hohenzollerns, the
young Prince wrote to his friend and fellow-guardsman,
Sergt. Karl Kummer, who had been
sent, badly wounded, to the home of his sister at
Teplitz:</p>

<p>My dear Kummer: How sincerely I rejoiced
to receive your very solicitous letter! I was sure
of Kummer for that; that no one could hold him
back when the time came to do some thrashing!
God grant that you may speedily recover, so that
you can enter Potsdam, crowned with glory, admired,
and envied. Who is nursing you?</p>

<p>The old proud First Guard Regiment has
proved that it was ready to conquer and to die.
Kummer, if I can in any way help you, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gladly do so, by providing anything that will
make you comfortable. You know how happy I
have always been for your devotion to the service,
and how we two always were for action
(Schwung). I, too, am proud to have been
wounded for our beloved Fatherland, and I regret
only that I am not permitted to be with the regiment.
Well, may God take care of you! Your
devoted</p>

<p>Interesting, too, is a letter written on Sept. 5
by Ernest II., Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, who, besides
being a Lieutenant of the Prussian Guard
and Chief of the Eighth Infantry Regiment of
Thuringia, is Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (since
1908), of Juliers, Cleves and Berg, Engern, and
Westphalia; Landgrave in Thuringia, Margrave
of Misnia, Count of Henneberg, Marche, Ravensberg,
and Seigneur of Ravenstein and Tonna. In
1898 the Duke married Princess Adelaide of
Schaumburg-Lippe, thus uniting two great German
houses. His own house was started in 1655
by Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen. His letter
follows:</p>

<p>We have lived through a great deal and done a
great deal, marching, marching, continually, without
rest or respite. On Aug. 10 we reached Willdorf,
near Jülich, by train, and from the 12th of
August we marched without a single day of rest
except Aug. 16, which we spent in a Belgian village
near Liége, until to-day, when we reached
&mdash;&mdash;. These have been army marches such as history
has never known.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, except that a broiling
heat blazed down upon us. The regiment can
point back to several days' marches of fifty kilometers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
&mdash;&mdash;. Everywhere our arrival created
great amazement, in Louvain as well as in Brussels,
into which the entire &mdash;&mdash; marched at one
time. At first we were taken for Englishmen in
almost every village, and we still are, because the
inhabitants cannot realize that we have arrived
so early. The Belgians, moreover, in the last few
days almost invariably set fire to their own villages.</p>

<p>On Aug. 24 we first entered battle; I led a combined
brigade consisting of &mdash;&mdash;. The regiment
fought splendidly, and in spite of the gigantic
strain put upon it, it is still in the best of spirits
and full of the joy of battle. On that day I was
for a long time in the sharpest rifle and artillery
fire. Since that time there have been almost daily
skirmishes and continual long marches; the enemy
stalks ahead of us in seven-league boots.</p>

<p>On Aug. 26 we put behind us a march of exactly
twenty-three hours, from 6:30 o'clock in the morning
until 5:30 the next morning. With all that, I
was supposed to lead my regiment across a bridge
to take a position guarding a new bridge in course
of construction; but the bridge, as we discovered
in the nick of time, was mined; twenty minutes
later it flew into the air.</p>

<p>After resting for three hours in a field of stubble,
and after we had all eaten in common with
the men in a field kitchen&mdash;as we usually do&mdash;we
continued marching till dark.</p>

<p>The spirit among our men is excellent. To-night
I am to have a real bed&mdash;the fourth, I believe,
since the war began. To-day I undressed
for the first time in eight days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The battle of Lyck, the victory of which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
heretofore been attributed solely to Field Marshal
von Hindenburg, would appear to have been won
by his subordinate, Gen. Curt E. von Morgen, according
to the following letter, written by Gen.
von Morgen to his friend Dr. Eschenburg, Mayor
of Lübeck, the city where, in peace times, Gen.
von Morgen was stationed as commander of the
Eighty-first Infantry Brigade. Gen. von Morgen
is 56 years old. He has been in the army since
1878, when he was appointed Lieutenant in the
Sixty-third Infantry Brigade. He served in the
German campaign in the Kamerun in 1894 and
suppressed the rebellion there in 1896 and 1897.
In the latter year he served also in the Thessaly
campaign, attached to the headquarters of Edhem
Pasha, and in 1898 he accompanied the German
Emperor on the latter's journey to Palestine. The
General wrote:</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Suwalki</span>, Sept. 13.
</p>

<p>Yesterday, after a short fight, I captured Suwalki,
and I am now seated in the Government
Palace. This morning I marched into the city
with my division, and was greeted at the city limits
by a priest and the Mayor, who offered me
bread and salt. (The Russian officials had fled.)
It was a glorious moment for me. I have appointed
a General Staff officer as Governor of the
Government of Suwalki.</p>

<p>To-morrow we continue to march against the
enemy. The army of Rennenkampf is completely
destroyed. Thirty thousand men captured. Rennenkampf
and the Commander in Chief, Nicholas
Nicholaiewitch, fled from Insterburg in civilian
garb.</p>

<p>The plan of the Russians was to get us into a
pot, but it was frustrated. The Twelfth Russian
Army Corps, which was advancing from the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to flank our army, was beaten by me on Sept. 7, at
Bialla, and on Sept. 9 at Lyck and was forced back
over the border.</p>

<p>You know that I always yearned for martial
achievements. I had never expected them to be
as great and glorious as these, however. I owe
them in the first place to the vigorous offensive
and bravery of my troops. I was probably foolhardy
on Sept. 9, when I attacked a force thrice
my superior in numbers, and in a fortified position;
but even if I had been beaten I should have
carried out the task assigned to me, for this Russian
corps could no longer take part in the decisive
battle. And so, in the evening, I sent in my
last battalion and attacked by storm the village
of Bobern, lying on the left wing. This, my last
effort, must so have impressed the Russians that
they began the retirement that very night. On
the morning of the 10th of September the last
trenches were taken.</p>

<p>My opponents were picked troops of the Russian
Army&mdash;Finnish sharpshooters.</p>

<p>Health conditions with me are tolerable.</p>

<p>(In a later note, Gen. von Morgen added that
Gen. von Hindenburg, his Commander in Chief,
sent word that he would never forget the valorous
deeds that had made possible these victories, and
that even before the battle of Lyck the Iron Cross
of the Second Class had been accorded to Gen.
von Morgen. When he entered Lyck, Gen. von
Morgen said, the inhabitants kissed his hands.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A letter containing a personal touch was sent
from the front in the early part of the war by
Rudolf Herzog, one of Germany's greatest living
poets and novelists. The letter, as originally published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was in rhymed verse. The poet, who visited
this country about a year ago and was fêted
by Germans in all the chief cities he visited, is the
author of numerous novels and romances, dating
from 1893 to the present. Herzog lives in a fine
old castle overlooking the Rhine, mentioned in his
letter, which is as follows:</p>

<p>It had been a wild week. The storm-wind swept
with its broom of rain. It lashed us and splashed
us, thrashed noses and ears, whistled through our
clothing, penetrated the pores of our skin. And
in the deluge&mdash;sights that made us shudder&mdash;gaunt
skeleton churches, cracked walls, smoking
ruins piled hillock high; cities and villages&mdash;judged,
annihilated.</p>

<p>Of twenty bridges, there remained but beams
rolled up by the waters&mdash;and yawning gaps.</p>

<p>Not a thought remained for the distant homeland
and dear ones far away; the only thought, by
day and by night: On to the enemy, come what
may! No mind intent on any other goal. No time
to lose! No time to lose! Haste! Haste!</p>

<p>And forward and backward and criss-cross
through the gray Ardennes the Chief Lieutenant
and I, racing day after day.</p>

<p>Captain of the Guard! You? From the Staff
Headquarters?</p>

<p>He shouts my name as he approaches:</p>

<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p>

<p>And he waves a paper above a hundred heads.</p>

<p>"Telegram from home! Make way, there, you
rascals! At the home of our poet&mdash;I've just
learned it&mdash;a little war girl has arrived!"</p>

<p>I hold the paper in my outstretched hand. Has
the sun broken suddenly into the enemy's land?
Light and life on all the ruins? * * *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Springtime scatters the shuddering Autumn
dreariness.</p>

<p>My little girl! I have a little girl in my
home! * * *</p>

<p>You bring back my smile to me in a heavy
time. * * *</p>

<p>I gaze up at the sky and am silent. And far and
near the busy, noisy swarm of workers is silent.
Every one looks up, seeking some point in the far
sky. Officers and men, for a single heart-throb,
listen as to a distant song from the lips of children
and from a mother's lips, stand there and smile
around me in blissful pensiveness, as if there were
no longer an enemy. Every one seems to feel the
sun, the sun of olden happiness.</p>

<p>And yet it had merely chanced that on the German
Rhine, in an old castle lost amid trees, a dear
little German girl was born.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following is written from the front by Corp.
T. Trainor:</p>

<p>We have had German cavalry thrown at us six
times in the last four hours, and each time it has
been a different body, so that they must have
plenty to spare. There is no eight hours for
work, eight hours for sleep, and eight hours for
play with us, whatever the Germans may do.</p>

<p>The strain is beginning to tell on them more
than on us, and you can see by the weary faces and
trembling hands that they are beginning to break
down.</p>

<p>One prisoner taken by the French near Courtrai
sobbed for an hour as though his heart were
broken, his nerves were so much shaken by what
he had been through. The French are fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
hard all round us with a grit and go that will
carry them through.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a little man fighting a
great, big, hulking giant who keeps on forcing the
little chap about the place until the giant tires
himself out, and then the little one, who has kept
his wind, knocks him over? That's how the fighting
here strikes me.</p>

<p>We are dancing about round the big German
Army, but our turn will come. Our commanders
know their business, and we shall come out on top
all right.</p>

<p>Sergt. Major McDermott does not write under
ideal literary conditions, but his style is none the
worse for the inspiration furnished by the shrieking
shell.</p>

<p>I am writing to you with the enemy's shells
bursting and screaming overhead; but God knows
when it will be posted, if at all.</p>

<p>We are waiting for something to turn up to be
shot at, but up to now, though their artillery has
been making a fiendish row all along our front,
we haven't seen as much as a mosquito's eyelash
to shoot at. That's why I am able to write, and
some of us are able to take a bit of rest while the
others keep "dick."</p>

<p>There is a fine German airship hanging around
like a great blue bottle up in the sky, and now and
then our gunners are trying to bring it down, but
they haven't done it yet.</p>

<p>It's the quantity, not the quality of the German
shells that is having effect on us, and it's not so
much the actual damage to life as the nerve-racking
row that counts for so much.</p>

<p>Townsmen who are used to the noise and roar
of streets can stand it better than the countrymen,
and I think you will find that by far the fittest men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are those of regiments mainly recruited in the big
cities.</p>

<p>A London lad near me says it's no worse than
the roar of motor 'buses and other traffic in the
city on a busy day.</p>

<h2><a name="GAELIC_SPIRIT_IRREPRESSIBLE" id="GAELIC_SPIRIT_IRREPRESSIBLE">GAELIC SPIRIT IRREPRESSIBLE.</a></h2>


<p>The Gaelic spirit has not deserted Sergt. T.
Cahill under fire. He writes:</p>

<p>The Red Cross girleens with their purty faces
and their sweet ways are as good men as most of
us, and better than some of us. They are not supposed
to venture into the firing line at all, but
they get there all the same, and devil a one of us
durst turn them away.</p>

<p>Mike Clancy is that droll with his larking and
bamboozling the Germans that he makes us nearly
split our sides laughing at him and his ways.</p>

<p>Yesterday he got a stick and put a cap on it so
that it peeped up above the trench just like a man,
and then the Germans kept shooting away at it
until they must have used up tons of ammunition.</p>

<p>But Mike Clancy was not the only practical
joker in the trenches, as the following from a
wounded soldier shows:</p>

<p>Our men have just had their papers from home,
and have noted, among other things, that "Business
as Usual" is the motto of patriotic shopkeepers.</p>

<p>In last week's hard fighting the Wiltshires,
holding an exposed position, ran out of ammunition,
and had to suspend firing until a party
brought fresh supplies across the open under a
heavy fire.</p>

<p>Then the wag of the regiment, a Cockney, produced
a biscuit tin with "Business as Usual"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
crudely printed on it, and set it up before the
trenches as a hint to the Germans that the fight
could now be resumed on more equal terms.</p>

<p>Finally the tin had to be taken in because it was
proving such a good target for the German riflemen,
but the joker was struck twice in rescuing it.</p>

<p>A wounded private of the Buffs relates how an
infantryman got temporarily separated from his
regiment at Mons, and lay concealed in a trench
while the Germans prowled around.</p>

<p>Just when he thought they had left him for good
ten troopers left their horses at a distance and
came forward on foot to the trench.</p>

<p>The hidden infantryman waited until they were
half way up the slope, and then sprang out of his
hiding place with a cry of "Now, lads, give them
hell!" Without waiting to see the "lads" the
Germans took to their heels.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HIGHLAND_KILT_A_POOR_UNIFORM" id="HIGHLAND_KILT_A_POOR_UNIFORM">HIGHLAND KILT A POOR UNIFORM.</a></h2>


<p>Why Highland kilts are not the ideal uniform
for modern warfare is concisely summed up by
Private Barry:</p>

<p>Most of the Highlanders are hit in the legs.
* * * It is because of tartan trews and hose,
which are more visible at a distance than any
other part of their dress. Bare calves also show
up in sunlight.</p>

<p>Private McGlade, writing to his aged mother
in County Monaghan, bears witness to the oft-made
assertion that the German soldiers object to
a bayonet charge:</p>

<p>I am out of it with a whole skin, though we were
all beat up, as you might expect after four days
of the hardest soldiering you ever dreamed of.
We had our share of the fighting, and I am glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to say we accounted for our share of the German
trash, who are a poor lot when it comes to a good,
square ruction in the open.</p>

<p>We tried hard to get at them many times, but
they never would wait for us when they saw the
bright bits of steel at the business end of our
rifles.</p>

<p>Some of our finest lads are now sleeping their
last sleep in Belgium, but, mother dear, you can
take your son's word for it that for every son of
Ireland who will never come back there are at
least three Germans who will never be heard of
again.</p>

<p>Before leaving Belgium we arranged with a
priest to have masses said for the souls of our
dead chums, and we scraped together what odd
money we had, but his Reverence wouldn't hear
of it, taking our money for prayers for the relief
of the brave lads who had died so far from the old
land to rid Belgian soil of the unmannerly German
scrubs.</p>

<p>Some of the Germans don't understand why
Irishmen should fight so hard for England, but
that just shows how little they know about us.</p>

<p>Seven British soldiers who after the fighting
round Mons last week became detached from their
regiments and got safely through the German
lines arrived in Folkestone to-day from Boulogne.
They belonged to the Irish Rifles, Royal Scots,
Somerset Light Infantry, Middlesex and Enniskillen
Fusiliers, and presented a bedraggled appearance,
wearing old garments given them by the
French to aid their disguise.</p>

<p>One of the seven, a Londoner, described the
fight his regiment had with the Germans at a village
near Maubeuge.</p>

<p>The British forces were greatly outnumbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by the Germans, but held their ground for twenty-four
hours, inflicting very heavy loss on the enemy,
although suffering severely itself.</p>

<p>He declared that the Germans held women up in
front of them when attacking. "It was worse
than savage warfare."</p>

<p>Paddy, an Irishman, stated that the soldiers got
little or no food during the fighting. "When we
got our bacon cooking the Germans attacked us."</p>

<p>A Scotsman of the party said he saw a hospital
flying the Red Cross near Mons destroyed by
shrapnel. "When we were ordered to retire," he
continued, "we did so very reluctantly. But we
did not swear. Things are so serious there, it
makes you feel religious."</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_MEN_IN_THE_FLEET" id="FROM_MEN_IN_THE_FLEET">FROM MEN IN THE FLEET.</a></h2>


<p>Equally interesting are some of the letters from
men with the fleet. Tom Thorne, writing to his
mother in Sussex, says:</p>

<p>Before we started fighting we were all very
nervous, but after we joined in we were all happy
and most of us laughing till it was finished. Then
we all sobbed and cried.</p>

<p>Even if I never come back, don't think I've died
a painful death. Everything yesterday was as
quick as lightning.</p>

<p>We were in action on Friday morning off Heligoland.
I had a piece of shell as big as the palm
of my hand go through my trousers, and as my
trouser legs were blowing in the breeze I think I
was very lucky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A gunroom officer in a battle cruiser writes:</p>

<p>The particular ship we were engaged with was
in a pitiful plight when we had finished with her&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
funnels shot away, masts tottering, great
gaps of daylight in her sides, smoke and flame
belching from her everywhere. She speedily
heeled over and sank like a stone, stern first. So
far as is known, none of her crew was saved. She
was game to the last, let it be said, her flag flying
till she sank, her guns barking till they could bark
no more.</p>

<p>Although we ourselves suffered no loss, we had
some very narrow escapes. Three torpedoes were
observed to pass us, one within a few feet. Four-inch
shells, too, fell short or were ahead of us.
The sea was alive with the enemy's submarines,
which, however, did us no damage. They should
not be underrated, these Germans. That cruiser
did not think, apparently, of surrender.</p>

<p>What naval warfare seems like to the "black
squad" imprisoned in the engineroom is described
by an engineer of the <i>Laurel</i>, who went through
the "scrap" off Heligoland. Writing to his wife
he says:</p>

<p>It was a terribly anxious time for us, I can tell
you, as we stayed down there keeping the engines
going at their top speed in order to cut off the
Germans from their fleet. We could hear the awful
din around and the scampering of the tars on
deck as they rushed about from point to point,
and we knew what was to the fore when we caught
odd glimpses of the stretcher bearers with their
ghastly burdens.</p>

<p>We heard the shells crashing against the sides
of the ship or shrieking overhead as they passed
harmlessly into the water, and we knew that at
any moment one might strike us in a vital part
and send us below for good.</p>

<p>It is ten times harder on the men whose duty
is in the engineroom than for those on deck taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
part in the fighting, for they, at least, have the excitement
of the fight, and if the ship is struck they
have more than a sporting chance of escape. We
have none.</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_A_DYING_FRENCHMAN" id="FROM_A_DYING_FRENCHMAN">FROM A DYING FRENCHMAN.</a></h2>


<p>The most dramatic letters come from the
French. On one of the fields of battle, when the
Red Cross soldiers were collecting the wounded
after a heavy engagement, there was found a half
sheet of notepaper, on which was written a message
for a woman, of which this is the translation:</p>

<p>Sweetheart: Fate in this present war has
treated us more cruelly than many others. If I
have not lived to create for you the happiness of
which both our hearts dreamed, remember that
my sole wish is now that you should be happy.
Forget me. Create for yourself some happy home
that may restore to you some of the greater pleasures
of life. For myself, I shall have died happy
in the thought of your love. My last thought has
been for you and for those I leave at home. Accept
this, the last kiss, from him who loved you.</p>

<p>Writing from a fortress on the frontier, a
French officer says the Colonel in command was
asked to send a hundred men to stiffen some reservist
artillery in the middle of France, far away
from the war area. He called for volunteers.
"Some of you who have got wives and children,
or old mothers, fall out," he said. Not a man
stirred. "Come, come," the Colonel went on.
"No one will dream of saying you funked. Nothing
of that kind. Fall out!" Again the ranks
were unbroken. The Colonel blew his nose violently.
He tried to speak severely, but his voice
failed him. He fried to frown, but somehow it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
turned into a smile. "Very well," he said, "you
must draw lots." And that was what they did.</p>

the markets was still in great quantities, although
eggs were not so plentiful, as the supply usually
comes from Galicia, which was then overrun by

<p>That the battle of Crouy was one of the bloodiest
engagements of the war is demonstrated by
the stories told by wounded soldiers reaching
Paris to-day. An officer gives this thrilling account
of the affray:</p>

<p>"After our successful advantage the Germans
counter attacked with fearful violence. How
strongly they were reinforced is shown by the fact
that they were 40,000 against less than 10,000
French. They first drove us from Vregny to
Crouy, then, because further reinforcements were
still reaching them, we were compelled to quit
Crouy, Bucy, Moncel, Sainte Marguerite and
Missy.</p>

<p>"These attacks certainly hit us hard, but our
losses are not comparable with those of the Germans,
for we killed an inconceivable number of
them. A battery covering our retreat alone annihilated
two battalions of Germans who advanced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as usual, in a mass. We could not resist,
so we left a small rearguard force with the mission
to hold on to the last man so that the bulk of
our 10,000 men could recross the Aisne.</p>

<p>"This force took cover behind an old wall and
belched fire on the advancing Germans until its
ammunition was exhausted. The Germans managed
to reach the other side of the wall, and even
grasped the barrels of our rifles thrust through
gaps. 'Surrender!' they cried. 'We won't harm
you.' But we continued mowing them down with
six mitrailleuses. The carnage was frightful, and
that moment a shell splinter struck me.</p>

<p>"A shell fire directed on our positions in the
Valley de Chivres was fearful. Those of our
troops who escaped said it was a continuous rain
of Jack Johnsons, which are impossible to dodge.</p>

<p>"Next day the Germans tried to pursue us
across the Aisne, but our artillery repulsed two
determined attacks, decimating several regiments,
which were forced to retreat to Moncel."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is a curious thing that shell explosions always
make hens lay. Just whether it's shock or not no
one is able to say as yet, but as soon as the soldiers
see a stray chicken after a fusillade they make a
dash for it in hopes of finding an egg. Some of the
soldiers are suggesting running a poultry farm on
the explosion system.</p>

<p>Eight Belgian heroes prevented the Germans
from piercing a weak spot in the Allies' line near
Dixmude. A patrol of eight Belgians with a machine
gun saw a column of Germans advancing.
The patrol took shelter in a deserted farm house.
Not until the German column was one hundred
yards away did the Belgians open fire. Then the
machine gun shot a spray of death into the column,
whose front rank just seemed to melt to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ground. The Germans pressed on bravely, their
officers urging them with hoarse cries. But discipline
had to bow to death, and the first rush was
stayed. Behind their rough shelter the Belgians
fired steadily, though outnumbered twenty to one.
For two hours the unequal fight continued, and
still the Belgians continued to pick off individual
Germans or melted down any threatening rush
with a shower of flame and death from the machine
guns. When relief finally came three of the
Belgians were dead and the other five desperately
wounded.</p>

He then telephoned to the trenches. In an hour

Under a heavy fire from the Germans the

<p>There are two plausible explanations of the
mystery that still surrounds the deposal of General
von Moltke, former Chief of Staff in the
Kaiser's war council. One story is that when von
Kluck was making his fierce drive to the very
gates of Paris, von Moltke was for having him
continue on to the coast. The Kaiser flatly decided
against von Moltke's strategy&mdash;which was
thoroughly justified by subsequent events. It
places von Moltke, however, in the untenable position
of one whose mere presence is the silent reproach
of "I told you so." The other explanation
is that von Moltke was too lavish in squandering
the lives of his men for petty gains, paying fancy
prices in blood for a few yards. The Over War
Lord finally called a halt.</p>

<p>That thousands of Russian women are rejoicing
over the fact that the sale of vodka has been prohibited
by the Russian Government was the news
brought by Mrs. Anna Omohundro, who arrived
on the Scandinavian-American liner <i>Oscar II</i>.
Mrs. Omohundro, who is an American woman and
a widow, has been living for the last three years
in Petrograd and Moscow, where her brother is
the agent for the International Harvester Company.</p>

<p>"For the first time," said she, "many Russian
wives find their homes livable. It appears that
the prohibition on vodka has worked wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
changes in a short time. I have heard of hundreds
of cases where men became home loving
and industrious because they were unable to get
the fiery liquor which turned their brains.</p>

<p>"There was one case in my own home in Moscow.
A woman servant came to me and fell on her
knees and said she wished to leave our service. I
asked her why she wished to go and she said:
'For the first time I am happy in my home and
wish to go there. My husband is no longer made
crazy by vodka. He is kind to me and I wish to
keep the home for him.'</p>

<p>"Of course the cases of reformation that I know
of personally are among the men who from one
cause or another have not joined the Russian
armies. I believe, however, that the benefit extends
throughout the nation."</p>


<h3><i>Twenty-seven Miles in Sleighs.</i></h3>

<p>Mrs. Omohundro made a journey of several
hundred miles to get out of Russia from Petrograd
to Stockholm, part of which was a trip in
sleighs of twenty-seven miles from Tornio, in
Finland, to Korning, Sweden. This trip took
about four hours and the ride was through the
rather weird twilight of midday in the northern
latitudes.</p>

<p>An amusing story was told of the stop at Tornio,
on the border, where the members of the
party were searched. Even the women did not
escape inspection by the Russian soldiers and all
postcards and suspicious looking papers were confiscated.
In the party was an English Jew who
was returning to London after selling out his
business in Moscow. It was noticed by some of
the travellers that the returning merchant, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
name was Cohen, frequently bought many boxes
of matches.</p>

<p>When the search took place at Tornio the many
boxes of matches in Cohen's baggage did not seem
to excite any suspicion among the Russian troopers.
After the party had passed over the border
Cohen opened up box after box and from the bottom
of each took a compact roll of money. He
had concealed about $12,000 in this way.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "I could not afford
to take any chances."</p>

<p>A correspondent of the London <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>
in Flanders telegraphs the following:</p>

<p>"The Germans had been attacked and driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
back during a certain engagement to their
trenches 400 yards from ours. Between the lines
a German officer fell, wounded by a bayonet. He
was nearer the British trenches than the German,
but whenever our men began to go out to carry in
the wounded man the German snipers got busy.
They would neither succor their tortured comrade
nor let the British do it.</p>

<p>"For nine days the wounded officer lingered.
Finally a British non-commissioned officer and one
or two privates crawled to the fallen man at night
and brought him in. For nine days he had lain
there, pierced by a bayonet from breast to back,
without food or drink. He was unconscious when
rescued and died soon afterward. During his
purgatory the gallant man, unable even to crawl,
had kept a diary, a record of physical and mental
anguish borne like a noble gentleman. On him
was found a photograph of his wife and two little
children.</p>

<p>"A British officer translated the diary to our
men and with a catch in his voice held up the
German officer as a hero to whom they should bow
their heads in reverence. The diary was sent to
headquarters, and perhaps has by now found its
way with the picture to the widow of this man."</p>

<p>"I recently visited one of the battlefields of
France. I saw in a village being shelled by German
guns a prisoner of war just being brought
into the French line. He was in a motor car
under guard. He was wounded and looked ill and
in pain.</p>

<p>"The French General with whom I had gone to
the front went up to the wounded Prussian and
told him he need not worry; he would be taken
straight to the hospital and looked after as if he
were one of our own men. The Prussian replied,
'We treated your wounded in exactly the same
way.'</p>

<p>"It was a curious rivalry under these conditions;
for you could hear the 'wizzle' of the German
shells and the shuddering crack with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
they exploded, dealing out death and destruction
in the French trenches close by. We were in
sight of a powerful French battery which was preparing
to send its deadly messengers into the
Prussian ranks.</p>

<p>"A little further on I marvelled that this exhibition
of good will among men who were sworn
foes should be possible amid such surroundings,
until my eyes happened to wander down a lane
where I saw a long row of wagons, each marked
with a great red cross. Then I knew who had
taught these brave men the lesson of humanity
that will gradually, surely overthrow the reign of

<p>"The <i>Sydney</i> was warned by a wireless message

speed; she made twenty-nine knots. When she

came out to give battle.</p>

<p>"The <i>Emden</i> got in the first three shots. Only
one landed, as after that the <i>Sydney</i> took care to
keep out of range. The larger guns fired 600
rounds, and after one and a half hours of action,
during which the ships covered fifty-six miles in
man&oelig;uvring, the <i>Sydney</i> forced the <i>Emden</i> to
beach herself, her steering gear having broken.</p>

<p>"The <i>Sydney</i> then put up a signal to surrender,
but as all on deck except three had been killed this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was not done. The <i>Sydney</i> accordingly gave her
two more broadsides as she lay on the beach.</p>

white flag the <i>Sydney</i> went off to sink the collier.
After this she returned to the <i>Emden</i> and sent
parties to help the survivors. It is said the <i>Emden</i>

<p>A dozen French infantrymen, mud-begrimed,

<p>Suddenly the Corporal stands erect; his pipe is

<p>The Saxon Minister of the Interior has been
obliged to direct the following warning to farmers
of the south German kingdom, according to a
Dresden dispatch in the <cite>Frankfurter Zeitung</cite>:</p>

<p>"The farmer has especial cause to thank the
German army that he can still gather in his harvest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and cultivate his fields, that his fields have
not been laid waste, and that the walls of his
farmhouse still remain standing and intact. For
this reason, however, he ought all the more to
show his gratitude by his acts and not grumble
when sacrifices are demanded of him, as of all
others.</p>

<p>"Thus, for instance, we hear of individual
cases, such as at the time of the mustering of
horses, when certain farmers demanded angrily
why they were called upon to sacrifice anything,
and gave expression to their anger because, in
the interests of the common weal, they were asked
to refrain from demanding exorbitant prices for
their products. In this manner the patriotic sentiments
of many farmers seem rather confusing.</p>

<p>"It is indeed not enough merely to belong to a
military society and wear a festive black coat on
the occasion of celebrating the birthday of the
Kaiser and King, or to drink at comfortable ease
in a cosy tavern an occasional glass of beer, pledging
the health of our troops. The main thing is
to give freely and gladly also of one's property

the most notable impression is one of utter surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
at the absence of movement and the lack of
noise.</p>

<p>Within one's range of vision, with a strong field
glass, there are probably concealed not fewer
than 100,000 men, yet except for the few French
soldiers with rifles in their hands standing or
kneeling in the immediate vicinity and keenly
peering over the flat land toward the positions
held by the Germans, no human presence was noticeable.</p>

<p>A staff officer said that behind a slight slope 300
yards away many German guns were hidden, but
only an occasional burst of flame and a sharp
whirring sound coming from an indefinite point
told of this artillery.</p>

<p>A little forest to the left bristles with machine
guns backed by infantry in rifle pits and covered
trenches. The approach to these positions has
been made almost impossible by barbed-wire entanglements
strewn with brush and branches of
trees and having the appearance of a copse of
heather.</p>

to infantry attacks.</p>

<p class="center">A LONG HANDSHAKE THE FIRST GREETING; THEN THEY
DROVE ACROSS THE BELGIAN FRONTIER.</p>


<p>The London <cite>Daily Mail</cite> correspondent sends
the following dispatch from Dunkirk, the date being
omitted:</p>

<p>"There was a historic incident on the roadside
in Flanders to-day when King George met King
Albert. The King of the Belgians, as the host,
was first at the rendezvous. He was dressed in
his usual quiet uniform of dark blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"As he alighted from his motor and walked toward
some old cottages here, he waited, and exchanged
kindly words with some Belgian soldiers
who came out of a neighboring inn to touch their
hats to their monarch.</p>

<p>"Noon struck from an old clock tower near at
hand, and a moment later a motor cyclist flying
the Union Jack was buzzing along the road toward
&mdash;&mdash;. Behind were three black limousine
cars, all flying Union Jacks, and behind them was
a second motor cyclist.</p>

<p>"The cars and cyclists stopped, and from the
first motor came King George and the Prince of
Wales with him. He wore a khaki uniform, with
a scarlet band round his hat. He looked fit and
well.</p>

<p>"The two kings moved forward with outstretched
hands to greet each other there in the
muddy road with none but a few officers, a few
soldiers, and simple villagers looking on.</p>

<p>"Upon a canal barge on the water alongside
the road a woman was hanging out her washing
on the mainmast and boom. All she saw was two
men shaking hands, but there was quiet earnestness
about that greeting. The handshake was
long and firm, and the accompanying smiles like
those of men who meet on serious occasions.</p>

<p>"Their first talk was not long. After returning
the salute of a soldier, who had come up close to
look on, they entered King Albert's motor car and
passed on over the frontier into the little remnant
of Belgium that still remains out of the enemy's
clutches.</p>

<p>"The two kings stayed a short time to review
the troops, Belgian and others, drawn up in the
village square, and then the monarchs drove on
together to here. They dined and talked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
friendly intimacy of the strange happenings that
had befallen the kingdoms of both and of the
great fights that have been fought."</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred British men and officers are in
the base hospital at Boulogne suffering from frozen
feet. Fully one thousand of this number must
have one or both feet severed, owing to the deadening
of the nerves, which makes futile all attempts
at treatment. Chilblains and frostbites
have been depleting the ranks worse than bullets
and shrapnel, and once a man's foot is frozen he
is through, as far as fighting is concerned, for the
rest of the war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Says one British officer now in the hospital:
"From the time I arrived at the front, three

meeting near Soissons with a French infantry soldier
who had just escaped from the Germans.
They had forced him, he said, with fifty others
captured at the same time, to dig trenches after
shooting those refusing. The soldier said:</p>

<p>"Under a French cannonade which killed many,
we were compelled by blows to dig in the most exposed
situation the trenches the Germans now
occupy, which are very wide and deep and cemented
against damp at frequent intervals. We
received only one meal, at 11 P. M. We had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

my comrades were most all killed, I crept from
one end of the trench and crawled 100 yards to a
shell hole, where I spent the following day. Then
I crawled 200 yards to the French trenches.</p>

<p>"The Germans received food and munitions
regularly, but seemed dispirited, and suffered
from rheumatism greatly. The majority are middle-aged.</p>

<p>The London <cite>Times</cite> military correspondent, giving
an account of the life led by the Prince of
Wales at the front, says:</p>

<p>"He won golden opinions. Personally of slight
physique and almost fragile looking, the Prince
was but little known to the army until he joined it,
and now that he is becoming known it is a revelation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
He is among the keenest and hardest soldiers
in the army. He walks more than six miles
before breakfast every morning, drives his own
car and spends every moment of the working day
in acquainting himself with the situation of the
troops and the service of the army.</p>

<p>"Although nominally attached to Sir John
French's staff, he is not chained there. He has
been attached in turn to army corps, divisional
and brigade headquarters and is undergoing an
education which no books can ever give him. Only
last week he occupied a house rocking and shaking
day and night with the bombardment, and he has
visited the trenches, including those of the Indian
army. It will be difficult to keep him out of the
firing line of his grenadiers.</p>

<p>"A more zealous and indefatigable young officer
does not serve with the King's troops. He has a
quiet, confident dignity which is most attractive
and his character and intelligence arouse the enthusiasm
of all who meet him. It was not exactly
the expression of a courtier, but it was the expression
of a truth, when an old soldier looked wistfully
after him and muttered, half to himself:
'That's a d&mdash;&mdash;d good boy!'"</p>

he has lost nothing of his freshness and elasticity.
His appearance has not altered in the least, and
yet every day he puts in twenty-four hours of
work. Everything must be reported to him and
he takes part in everything.</p>

<p>"I am often asked: 'How is the Kaiser able to
bear this physical and mental strain?' I think the
correct answer is that he is able to bear it because
his conscience is clear; that he feels himself innocent
before God and man of having caused this
war and that he knows he has done everything in
his power to prevent it. The Germanic cause cannot
wish for any better representative than the
Kaiser, and it would almost appear that he had
been born for this crisis. For, just as he did all in
his power to keep the peace, he feels now that he
is responsible for the development of German
destiny, and with this in view he devotes to the
cause all his feelings, thoughts and acts."</p>

There was a regular debauch of shells from

<p>The story of a thrilling airship raid by French

<p>The captain in command of the airship had received
orders to try to destroy a railway junction

line was well guarded, and it was necessary to
cross the enemy's position for a considerable

dropped in rapid succession three dynamite
charges upon the station, with considerable damage
to the tracks.</p>

<p>The airship by that time had been discovered

guns and mortars in the neighborhood were aimed
at it. The sky was ablaze with bursting shells,
some coming dangerously near.</p>

airship's crew was enabled to rise rapidly. As a
departing salute it attempted to drop a fourth
charge of dynamite.</p>

<p>Just then something went wrong which threatened
the airship with instant destruction. The
dynamite charge got stuck in the tube.</p>

<p>The automatic detonator already had been set
in motion. The captain seized a hatchet and
climbed over the rigging. He struck a few desperate

dynamite exploded with a terrific detonation long

forty-eight hours was a German who had been
struck by an aeroplane dart. He was evidently
bending over when hit, for the dart had entered
the right thigh and traversed the whole leg, so
that the point emerged just above the boot. The
man was conscious when he was brought in, and
said he felt no pain, only a heavy blow. He died
soon afterward from shock and loss of blood."</p>

<p>The darts resemble steel pencils. They are
about five inches long with the unpointed end
half-fluted to insure their falling head first. It is
calculated that they strike with a hundred pounds
force if thrown from an elevation of 1,000 metres.</p>

continues:</p>

<p>During a fortnight's sojourn with his armies in

according to a Petrograd correspondent. His

field hospitals, addressing kindly words to them.
In one ward, entirely occupied by wounded Germans,
the men, who were unable to rise, spontaneously
greeted the Czar with a three-fold
Hoch!</p>

<p>The Czar inquired about the identity and direction
of a column passing the imperial train. He
was told they were officers and men recovered
from wounds returning to their respective regiments.
His Majesty alighted and asked where
and how they had been wounded. It appeared
they all had participated in the early battles of

<p>"A German regiment with the flag flying approached
our trenches to about 300 yards. It was
met by a heavy discharge of our machine guns
and rifle fire, and fell back in disorder. Immediately
it reassembled some distance away. Once
more we saw it advance, with the ranks already
thinner. It came to within 100 yards of us, when
it was received as before and again beaten back.</p>

<p>"This time the order was sent through our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

did so; then the order to fire at will was given.

<p>Soldiers who have been fighting near Roye say
that the hostile trenches there are only fifteen
yards apart at some points, so that the enemies
can hear each other talking. Last week a company
of sappers were misled by the darkness right
into a German trench, where a squad of Teuton
sappers were at work. The men fought in the
dark with picks and shovels until rifles also began
to crack, whereupon each side drew back.</p>

<p>French cemeteries, with their strong stone
tombs, sometimes play an important part in the
hostilities. Thus the Germans have intrenched
themselves on a cemetery height near Roye and
have made it a strong position. The vaults offer
a safe shelter against rain and shrapnel, while
metallic coffins have been placed along the edge
of the trenches as a protection against rifle fire.</p>

<p>A thrilling incident in the wonderful retreat of

over his own part in an extraordinary act of heroism.</p>

<p>"One of our officers asked for a man to go with

Wells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, to blow a bridge up we use guncotton
and a wire fuse. It is safe enough if you take
your wire well away, but this time it would not
work. Our men in running back had stepped on
the wire, so we had to go nearer to the bridge and
try again. Even then it would not act, so the officer
said to me, 'Get out of the way, Wells.' I
said, 'No, I'll go with you.' We were the only two
on the bridge and the Germans were shooting at
us, but our luck was in. Well, we both lay down
and I fired ten rounds at the guncotton with my
rifle, and he did the same with a pistol, but it
wouldn't work. If it had we should have gone
with it, so you see what a shave we had. We
made a dive back and got some more guncotton,
and were making to have another go when an officer
ordered us back, saying it was no use trying."</p>

<p>"It may be admitted that the position at Ypres
two days ago was serious. The town itself was
bombarded by the Germans with great violence
and under the fierce cannonading the Allies had
to withdraw from the town, which became a 'No
Man's Land,' shells from both sides bursting
across it.</p>

<p>"The Germans made a final effort under cover
of a fierce bombardment of the British positions.
They had prepared a determined onslaught.
Masses of men were launched in succession at
chosen points on the allied front. The assault was
met in a supreme way.</p>

<p>"Two regiments, one Scottish and one of the
Guards, went down with bayonets to stem the advance.
It was the most terrible bayonet charge
of the whole war. It succeeded, the break in the
line was repaired and the German attack was once
more driven back.</p>

<p>"That was their last effort. The Germans are
now assailing the allied line at Arras, forty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
further to the south, but not with the same fury
as they exhibited in the onslaught of the past

have reached 100,000, though these figures may

in height, with iron-gray hair and mustache. His
companion was a younger man, with a red band
around his cap, denoting, I believe, he belonged
to the General Staff.</p>

<p>"The prisoners were surrounded by the usual
hooting, jeering crowd. Suddenly one of the
guards deliberately prodded the big colonel in the
back with the butt end of his rifle. It was a
brutal act. The next moment the gray-haired officer
turned around and struck his tormentor full
in the face with his fist. It was a fine blow.</p>

<p>"I saw no more, for the crowd in a paroxysm of

<p>The London <cite>Daily Mail's</cite> Paris correspondent
reports an interview with a French airman on the
new French air bomb.</p>

<p>"I have used both the dynamite bomb and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
new bomb," said the aviator. "The two are very
similar in size and weight, but the effect as seen
from above is very different.</p>

<p>"When a dynamite bomb falls upon a body of
men you can see the bodies leap up in air. It is
like a small volcano in action. When the new
bomb bursts it simply lays everything out flat
within the area of its explosion. It seems to exert
the whole of its force in waves like the ripples
made when a large stone is thrown into a pond.
The men go down like ninepins; buildings collapse
like houses of playing cards; guns are turned over
as if by some unseen hand.</p>

<p>"The explosion raises practically no dust or
smoke. Even the earth disturbed by the case of
the bomb striking the ground is instantly flattened
out by the same extraordinary waves of
force. Extreme cold is produced at the moment
of the explosion. It is so intense that I felt it
myself when I dropped my first bomb at a height
of about 800 feet.</p>

<p>"I was taking great chances in flying so low,
but I wished to see the effect of the bomb. It fell
on a section of Germans bivouacking in a field. I
estimate that at least thirty men were killed
within the area of the explosion. Death from
these bombs comes instantly from intense cold and
concussion."</p>

the message.</p>

<p>"'The Gurkhas are to move further up the
trench; another Gurkha contingent is advancing
in support.'</p>

<p>"The English was good, but something excited

<p>"This question, under the circumstances, was
no easy one to answer, and the German (for such
he was) turned and fled, but he had not gone five
yards before he fell, riddled with bullets.</p>

of course, would have swarmed with Germans almost
before the Gurkhas had made room for

<p>The Germans are suffering intensely from the

carried off all the available winter clothing, furs,
sheepskins and leather coats. At Lodi and Shiradow,
where there are great cloth factories, they
commandeered the whole of the stocks and kept

<p>"Night before last we were told that the regiment
was going to be relieved by the Indians. I
was delighted till I heard that my troops were to
stay out to give them moral support, as it was
their first go&mdash;a compliment, I suppose, although
I didn't think so at the time. It was the most

all set alight by shell fire, when these fellows with
turbans and with flashing eyes and teeth came up
out of the darkness. The undefeated dragoons, of
course, became firm friends with them at once.
French, Belgians, Indians&mdash;they make pals with
them all.</p>

<p>"Well, these natives had hardly got into the
trenches on either side of me when the Germans
opened fire. It was the worst half hour I've ever
spent. As, of course, I couldn't make them understand
and as they had never seen shells before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
didn't know what they would do. They behaved
splendidly, and I think they thought the shells
were fireworks let off for their benefit.</p>

<p>"The officer in charge of them told me that
morning that he was most frightfully anxious as
to how they'd do, but they shouted with glee when
they saw a German and let him know what good
shots they are. In the middle of the attack one
native hurled himself into my trench and spoke
excitedly to me. Of course, I couldn't make out
what he wanted, but thought he wanted a doctor
for some one, as he kept pointing at a cartridge,
so I sent down for him, but when he arrived I discovered

nasty wounds and rebandaged them with a pocket
bandage I happened to have with me. The soldier
fumbled in his pocket, and at last produced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
crumpled five-franc note which he offered me. I
refused it.</p>

<p>"'Why do you refuse good money for a good
action, madame?' he said.</p>

<p>"'Because I am an English woman,' I replied,
'and English women do not take payment for
good deeds, however great or small they may be.'</p>

<p>"'I cannot believe you are English,' he said,
'but you are an angel, and angels have no nationality.
May I kiss your hand?'</p>

<p>"I held out my hand. He bent low and kissed
it. There were tears in his eyes, and I rather
wish now I had accepted the five-franc note to
keep as a souvenir of Prussian gratitude."</p>

<p>"Among the wounded was a young Frenchman
with a gold medal about which he refused to speak,
and a slight wound in the foot about which he
made considerable fuss," cables a correspondent.
"Disgusted by these complaints among so much
suffering silently borne, my informant elicited
from the youth's comrades the following story,
which subsequently was verified:</p>

<p>"At a point where the French trenches were
barely fifty yards from the enemy's a party of
Germans sang songs during the night which infuriated
the French&mdash;'They wouldn't let us sleep
with their howling,' as one of the French soldiers
put it. Finally one little chasseur, crying, 'I will
silence them,' seized a rifle and disappeared before
any one could detain him.</p>

<p>"After a moment's silence came the crackle of
rapid firing, followed by German shrieks and wild
volleys. The firing continued, accompanied by
shouts in French as from an officer directing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
attack; then in guttural tones: 'Stop! Stop!
We surrender.' A few minutes later the little
chasseur reappeared escorting several unarmed
Germans. He said: 'You can occupy the trench;
there's nothing but corpses left to defend it.'</p>

<p>"Advancing, the French discovered forty dead
Germans in the trench, killed by the little chasseur,
firing from the end, whither he had crawled
unnoticed. In some cases the same bullet pierced
several Germans."</p>

<h2><a name="RUSSIAN_AIRMANS_RUSE" id="RUSSIAN_AIRMANS_RUSE">RUSSIAN AIRMAN'S RUSE.</a></h2>


<p>The story of the strategy of a Russian aviator
which got him out of a tight corner, is cabled from
Petrograd:</p>

<p>A Russian airman accompanied by an observation
officer was flying over the enemy's territory
when he was obliged to descend owing to engine
trouble. The pilot and the officer were wearing
leather clothes without any distinctive mark.</p>

<p>They were working on the motor when suddenly
seven Austrian soldiers in charge of an
under officer appeared over the crest of a little
hill and approached them.</p>

<p>Resistance was impossible, for the Russians
had no weapons but revolvers. Fortunately the
officer knew German. Calling loudly to the Austrian
officer he ordered him in a peremptory manner
to come and help him mend the motor. The
Austrian, believing he was in the presence of a
superior officer, hastened with his men to obey,
and soon the engine had been put right.</p>

<p>The aeroplane started off, and as it ascended
in spirals to the clouds a paper fell at the feet of
the gaping Austrians. It contained a short message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of thanks to the officer and his men for giving
such timely aid to Russian aviators.</p>

<p>The Earl of Kingston, who is an officer in the
Irish Guards, in a letter to his wife at Kildonin
Castle, County Roscommon, from France, says:</p>

<p>"We had a bad night last night in the trenches,
as we are only 800 yards from the Germans, and
both sides are as jumpy as fleas, loosing off at any
moment, and the guns are keeping up a terrific
fire on us, but doing little damage. We had two
killed and two wounded yesterday.</p>

<p>"They have a large gun here that was meant
for the siege of Paris. It throws a shell thirty-two
inches long and makes a hole big enough to
bury eighteen men in. This battle has been on
for ten days and we hope for the best.</p>

<p>"We have a farm here that has been taken and
retaken, but we have it again at present. It is
lovely at night, with hundreds of shells bursting
all around, and if it were not for the death they
bring they might be fireworks on a large scale.</p>

<p>"I have lost my servant and all my kit. Please
send me out some cigarettes, tobacco and
matches."</p>

<p>One of the British flying corps, Lieut. Rainey,
crossed the Channel from France in a much damaged
machine, thus completing in a fitting manner
a series of thrilling adventures which have befallen
him since he last left English soil.</p>

<p>Lieut. Rainey had been engaged for three weeks
in reconnoitring at the front, and so little leisure
had he been able to snatch that, as he told his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
friends here, in the whole of that time he could
not remove his clothes, or even get a wash.</p>

<p>He had two machines disabled by rifle and shell
fire, while a third caught fire in midair. On each
of these occasions he very narrowly escaped losing
his life.</p>

<p>Once when he came down he was so exhausted
that he lay with his head on his aeroplane and
fell fast asleep. On waking he was astonished to
find that the puttee, boot and sock of one leg had
been removed by some one who, as the lieutenant
himself suggested, took the opportunity of his
slumber to get them as mementoes.</p>

<p>Lieut. Rainey brought home with him a German
helmet belonging to a man he shot, and he proudly
asserted it was the first trophy of the kind taken
by a British airman.</p>

<p>An official communication issued by the French

<p>"The following are extracts from a letter found
on a German prisoner, dated Dusseldorf, Oct. 4:</p>

<p>"'With us officers and soldiers are becoming

60 per cent. of the German shells fail to explode;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
985 shells fell on a single battery, killing only two
horses.</p>

<p>The extent of invisible fighting in the war is
shown by the revelation of an artilleryman now
resting with his regiment. He entered the battle
line at the beginning of the war and after ten
weeks of continuous fighting has not seen a single

<p>Proof that high German officers will not tolerate
insults to women by their men is furnished in the
following cable from a correspondent in Antwerp:</p>

<p>"Gen. von Beseler is a pleasant-looking old gentleman
with a white mustache. He conducted himself
most correctly toward every one in the hotel.
On the other hand, one of his junior officers immediately
asked for a hot bath and made exacting
demands, culminating in a gross insult to the
chambermaid. For this he was severely reprimanded
by Von Beseler, who told the girl, patting
her kindly on the shoulder, to report to him at
once any further annoyance.</p>

<p>"A drunken soldier grossly insulted a poor
woman on the street. She complained to an officer,
who at once emptied a revolver into the
offender's body, killing him. This had a salutary
effect on the attitude of the troops toward the
female population, for I heard of no similar outrage."</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_FEE" id="SOME_FEE">SOME FEE!</a></h2>


<p>A fee of $35,000 was paid to a French surgeon
of Epernay for operating on the wounded German
Crown Prince. There was a certain retributive
justice on the size of the fee, for $35,000 was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
precise amount the Germans demanded as a war
contribution from Epernay.</p>

<p>During the battling on the Marne the Crown
Prince was seriously wounded. No German surgeon
was in Epernay, so the Germans asked a
well-known Paris surgeon, Dr. Veron, to operate,
telling him they would pay any fee. Dr. Veron
fixed the fee at an amount equal to the enforced
war contribution, and that sum the German army
treasurer paid in gold.</p>

<h2><a name="CALLS_FOE_TREACHEROUS" id="CALLS_FOE_TREACHEROUS">CALLS FOE TREACHEROUS.</a></h2>


<p>In a letter written to relatives in London Corporal
N. Hastings of the Guards accuses the Germans
of treachery. He writes:</p>

<p>"If the papers were permitted to send their
correspondents to the front they would have something
to say which would open the eyes of the
world about the Germans. It is an insult to Zulus
to compare these squareheads to them for treachery.
Some of them fight fair and square, but
there are thousands of them who are devoid of all
human feeling. Near the banks of the River
Aisne they had been attacked and driven down by
rifles and machine guns. A small number of the
Northamptons were in a trench when 400 or 500
of the Germans held their hands up. The 'Cobblers'
were ordered not to fire, and an officer asked
in French and English if they surrendered.</p>

<p>"They came on in skulking manner and some
of them threw down their rifles. In every way
they showed they were giving themselves up as
prisoners. The 'Cobblers' were priding themselves
on the capture and the officer said, 'We
have a haul here,' as they got near the trench.
When they were three or four yards away they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
poured a murderous fire at the poor fellows. They
had not a dog's chance and nearly all were
knocked over. The devils then tried to get back
and ran for their lives, but our battalion was soon
after them. Before they got many yards a machine
gun ripped them up and scores of them
rolled over. Some of them got away, but our battalion
got them in the rear. Our lads were simply
furious at such treachery.</p>

<p>"I had a narrow shave as I fell over one of
their wounded, and before I could get up again a
bullet whizzed through the sleeve of my coat, but
he who fired was shot through the head the next
second. Some of the German officers are low
bred. They are not like ours&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;and
when they get a chance they gorge themselves and
get mad drunk, so what can you expect from their
men? I have spoken to several prisoners&mdash;one
seemed a decent chap and spoke English well,
having worked in London&mdash;and they admit it.
The one who spoke English was a sergeant and he
said his officers were perfectly mad because they
were unable to get into Paris."</p>

<p>The story of how the first recommendation for
the Victoria Cross was won in the present war is
told in two letters. The first is from the hero
himself, an English soldier named Dobson, to his
wife in North Shields. He says very modestly:</p>

<p>"You will know by the time you receive this
letter that I have been recommended for the Victoria
Cross, an honor I never thought would come
my way. I only took my chance and did my duty
to save my comrades. It was really nothing."</p>

<p>The second letter is by Lady Mildred Follet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
whose husband commands the company to which
Dobson belongs, and is addressed to Mrs. Dobson.
It reads:</p>

<p>"You will be glad to know that your husband is
very well and has behaved with very great gallantry.
Capt. Follet says: 'A thick fog came
down, so I sent three men out 100 yards to our
front to give warning of an attack by the enemy.
After they had been there an hour the fog suddenly
lifted and they were fired on at close range.
One man was killed, one badly wounded and one
crawled back. I didn't know how to get the
wounded man back, so I called for a volunteer,
and Reservist Dobson at once responded and went
out to fetch him. He was heavily fired at but not
hit.'"</p>

The Big Furor</p>

<p class="center">in books on the subject of war has been created by</p>
<p class="center b13">GERMANY</p>

<p class="center b12">AND THE NEXT WAR</p>

<p class="center">BY GENERAL F. VON BERNHARDI
</p>

<p>This book presents a clear exposition of the
German attitude in the European War, and predicts
with remarkable accuracy the plan of campaign
of the German Army in their attacks on
Belgium and France. General Bernhardi claims
that England is stationary or retrogressive in the
world's progress, that Germany is the coming
world power, who by her rise will elevate the
world's standard of civilization, art and commerce;
that Germany's rise is in fact <strong>civilization's
greatest asset</strong>.</p>

<p>The coolness with which the author assumes
his views to be true, without argument or evidence,
takes one's breath away.</p>

<p>War all around is considered with composure:
war with England; France overthrown;
Belgium conquered; and the balance of power in
Europe to be deliberately destroyed. The two
chapters on the inevitable naval war with England
are of great interest.</p>

<p>The book is a 12 mo., contains 288 pages
printed from new large type and is bound in substantial
paper cover. <strong>Price, 25 cents postpaid.</strong></p>

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY<br />
AND THE WAR</p>

<p class="center">By ERNEST LUDWIG<br />
<br />
I. &amp; R. Consul for Austria-Hungary, in Cleveland, Ohio,<br />
with preface by his excellency<br />
<br />
DR. KONSTANTIN THEODOR DUMBA<br />
Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to the United States
</p>

<p>This book contains a comprehensive presentation
of the political forces and historical developments
which led to the initial clash of arms. It offers a
graphic description of conditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
the two Austrian provinces coveted by
Servia, and throws an illuminating light upon the
real, the underlying causes of the world-conflict.</p>

<p>It gives detailed particulars of the Serajevo trial
in which the assassination of the Crown Prince and
his consort is proved to have been committed by
members of the notorious "Narodna Odbrana" society
of Servia, with the guilty fore-knowledge and complicity
of the Servian Government and tells why
Servia's equivocal note regarding this was not acceptable,
making necessary from the Austro-Hungarian
standpoint, the declaration of war against Servia
which brought on the present European Conflict.</p>

<p>The chapter on the greater Russian propaganda
is based on confidential and official reports, now made
known for the first time.</p>

<p>The chapter dealing with economic conditions in
Austria-Hungary contains entirely new facts, official
and authentic.</p>

<p>The book contains 220 pages, size 7&frac12; × 5
inches, substantially bound in cloth. PRICE, ONE
DOLLAR, net; postage 10 cents additional.</p>
